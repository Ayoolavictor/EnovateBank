# EnovateBank <br>
## Decentralized Bank App <br>
## Project Description <br>
<p> This project was built using Solidity and React, it is a decentralized banking application and it aims to replicate the two most important features of the traditional banking system
which is Savings and Loans. </p>
<p> Through this DApp users can interact with a decentralized banking system which is powered by the ENOVATE TOKEN. Users can save their ETH in the bank with will accured interest
based on the amount of Ether deposited and the amount of time it stays in the contract. The special features of this savings system is that Users can withdraw their deposit in bits and still receive
interest on the remaining amount till it is also withdrawn. Another feature is that the interests are paid in ENV. </p>
<p>The second feature of this bank is that users can borrow ENV and pay back later. Collateral would have to be deposited in Ether which will determine how much token is borrowed to the user with the ratio 1:100, which means
1 ether= 100 ENV. When the user is ready to pay back a 10% fee is deducted from the collateral but 5% of the ENV borrowed is given to the user.</p> <br>
